- Why?

Because Filip wants us to have fun while learning. <br>
Whether we want to or not. <br>
**LEARNING CODE IS FUN I TELL YA.**

- When?

Today's the day.
Time for play.

It actually took me 2 days.

- How?

Our dear friends from freeCodeCamp.org made a nice tutorial to watch. I watched this and some code examples to try and understand it as well as being able to copy paste it ;-). I found it difficult to understand so I quit the tutorial and begged Raf for some help. I tried to break everything down until I understood the parts. My code is probably too long or could probably be more efficient but I still am superproud.

- Who?

Yours truly.
